# Helsinki Citybike tracking app

This is an app (UI and a backend service) for displaying data from journeys made with city bikes in the Helsinki Capital area.

To run the app download three datasets of journey data. The data is owned by City Bike Finland.

-   <https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-05.csv>
-   <https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-06.csv>
-   <https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-07.csv>

Also, there is a dataset that has information about Helsinki Region Transportâ€™s (HSL) city bicycle stations. **RENAME THIS STATIONS FILE TO stations.csv**

-   Dataset: <https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/726277c507ef4914b0aec3cbcfcbfafc_0.csv>

## The app

This is a web application that uses a backend service to fetch the data.
Backend is made with NodeJS and frontend uses React and NextJS. Language used is TypeScript.

Backend uses a MongoDB database, which is hosted in whatever MongoDB instance you wish to use (use environment variable MONGO_URI to provide a MongoDB URI address). If you use the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose the MongoDB instance will run in Docker container and the backend will connect to that instance. The database is populated with the data from the CSV files at startup.

## Functionality

### Data import

-   Data is imported from the CSV files to a database
-   Data is validate before importing (with JSON-Schema and PapaParse)
-   Journeys that lasted for less than ten seconds are not imported
-   Journeys that covered distances shorter than 10 meters are not imported

### Journey list view

-   Journeys are listed in a table with pagination and sorting per column
-   Journeys can be filtered by distance or duration and searched by station name (departure or return)
-   Journeys are fetched from the database one page at a time
-   For each journey departure and return stations, covered distance in kilometers and duration in minutes are shown

### Station list

-   List all the stations in a table with pagination and sorting per column
-   Pagination is done by fetching all stations (since there are not too many) and showing one page at a time
-   Searching by what ever you want
-   Clicking on a station opens a single station view

### Single station view

-   Shows station name, address, location on the map and number of journeys starting and ending at the station
-   Shows also the average distance of a journey starting/ending from the station
-   Shows Top 5 most popular return/departure stations for journeys starting/ending from the station
-   Ability to filter all the calculations per date range (start and end date of the journey) - this is using local time of the client browser

## Extra functionality

-   There are endpoints to store new journeys data or new bicycle stations
-   Backend and MongoDB database can be run in Docker (run `docker-compose up` in the root folder)
-   There is UI for adding journeys or bicycle stations (click on the "Add" button in the table header bars of the journey or station list views)

## Running the app

### Backend

-   Add .env file with environment variables (see .env.example)
-   Make a new folder `static` in the root folder and put the downloaded CSV files there (remember to rename the stations file to stations.csv)
-   Install NodeJS and NPM
-   Install dependencies with `npm install`
-   Run the backend with `npm start`
-   Backend will be running at <http://localhost:3100> (or whatever port you have set in the environment variable PORT)
-   If you want to run the backend in Docker, run `docker-compose up` in the root folder (this will also run MongoDB in a Docker container) - remember to add the CSV files to the `static` folder before running the Docker containers

### Frontend

-   Install NodeJS and NPM
-   Install dependencies with `npm install`
-   Run the frontend with `npm run dev`
-   Frontend will be running at <http://localhost:3000>
